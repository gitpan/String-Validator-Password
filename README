String-Validator-Password

String::Validator::Password is part of the String Validator Collection.

It will check a string against any number of password validation rules, and optionally
against a second string (as in password confirmation box on a webform). The
primary Negative method returns 0 if the password passes all tests, or a string
describing the errors if it fails. The Positive Method returns 1 if the string
passes and 0 if it fails. The ErrString method returns the errors from the last
string processed.
